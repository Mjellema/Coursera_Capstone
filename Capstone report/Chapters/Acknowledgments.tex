\section{Acknowledgements}
I would like to take the opportunity to thank Guido van Rossum: the creator of Python. I've been programming since ANSI C was the standard and Turbo Pascal 5.0 was the new kid on the block, but in all those years I never came across a language that uses soo few lines of code to accomplish so much. As mentioned before, adding just a few libraries and you have a very powerful programming toolbox at hand.
\\\\
Next to Guido, I'd like to thank all the programmers and contributors that share their code, their examples and answer the questions raised by co-programmers on platforms like Stack Overflow, Medium, GitHub and many others: without your explanations my life as a python programmer would have been a lot tougher.

Let me sign off with thanking IBM and Coursera for setting up this course. I was a bit reluctant at first having to complete nine courses to get a single certificate and that much of the reviewing and grading would be done by co students, but you guys have managed to setup an honourable community and the course materials where tough enough to make me proud that I have passed the test.
