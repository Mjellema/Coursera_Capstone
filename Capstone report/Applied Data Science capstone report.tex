\section*{Introduction}
I tasked myself with the assignment to find additional ways to enhance automatic estimation of house prices in the Netherlands. The use of the \textbf{FourSquare} API is mandatory for this assignment, part of the IBM Data Science professional certificate \cite{IBM1}. As a tech savvy person myself, I'd heard of FourSquare and I do remember seeing the FourSquare logo on venues in the past, but never came across its footprint in the Netherlands. Wondering if I could use the FourSquare API in finding an answer for a challenge in the Netherlands, I did some research and as it turns out, the FourSquare database is more than comprehensive enough to use for data science challenges in the Netherlands as well. Not knowing a single person actively using FourSquare to let their friends know where they check-in, it puzzled me how FourSquare actually accumulates their data. James D. Walsh wrote a nice article \cite{FS1} on how FourSquare accomplishes this. Enough about FourSquare for now, let's focus on introducing the question I want to answer with help of the FourSquare API and the data it can provide:
\medskip
\begin{quote}
\textit{Based on \textbf{FourSquare} data, can we find a correlation between the average house price, the number of restaurants and the number of inhabitants in the provinces of the Netherlands?}

\end{quote}
\medskip
Although the COVID pandemie is having an impact on the overall economy world wide, it seems house prices have not yet taken a hit due to the pandemic. Startups like \textbf{Promodomo} \cite{Promo} use algorithms to calculate house prices, even when they are not on the market yet. Algorithms like Promodomo's always benefit from additional sources to enrich their calculation. Searching for a correlation based on FourSquare data is just one off the many possibilities to augment the estimation of house prices and this is why I choose to take this challenge and come up with answers in this capstone project of my IBM Data Science Professional certificate.
